I was depressed, severely underweight, anxious and unable to sleep - and I was a hospital inpatient. I got to a point of just wanting, or needing, to hand over control, to stop the noise in my head, pause the constant racing thoughts in my mind. To be able to just be still, rest, not have to fight myself anymore. Olanzapine gave me that opportunity in a way. It gave me peace for the first time in months. It didnt stop the pain or the anxiety, but it gave me the ability to rest, sleep, and relax. Olanzapine is a drug that is feared particularly for the notorious weight-gain side effect, which, if Im honest, is one of the reasons I refused it several times before actually taking it.', 2, 2022-04-27),

One advantage of amoxicillin over penicillin is that it is effective against a broader range of bacteria. Bad tooth infection and dentist gave Amoxicillin 3 x 500 mg a day. Day 3 no side effects and pain gone/swelling reducing. For penicillin, this was given for my sons lyme disease. Penicllin must be used long term. Got my son well in 9 months.', 3, 2022-11-20),

I was taken off the medication for approximately 2 months for other medical issue including UTI and started seeing a slight improvement.I was given the start up dose again because of the gap in treatment and by 3rd shot (start up dose) I was experiencing extreme pain again. I have been taken off the medication again to see if the bladder pain will improve. Not thinking what I am experiencing is worth taking the medication.

Coincidentally, I became very ill a couple of days later with persistent high fevers. After taking Percocet every 4 h around the clock, the pain went away. The best way I can describe the feeling I had when taking the Percocet is that all was right with the world. I felt that I could function at a higher level, and that I had more energy and motivation. Stressful situations seemed easily manageable, and I felt more focused on whatever I happened to be doing. I did not perceive that anything was wrong with taking the Percocet after the reason it was prescribed had resolved, because after all, they had been prescribed to me. Maybe I did know better, but the feeling I received from the medication pushed any questions I might have had out of my head. I am now a recovering addict and can say becareful to not take a medication out of hand.', 2, 2023-03-01);
